# Analysis of Student Performance in INSY107: Information Technology Today Course (2020-2023)

## Background Information
The objective of this analysis is to comprehensively assess the performance of students enrolled in the university course unit, INSY107 Information Technology Today, spanning the years 2020 to 2023. The findings from this analysis will provide valuable insights and trends to inform teaching methods and course management. 
### Key questions guiding this analysis include:
1. Are there discernible differences in the academic performance between male and female students?

3. Do student grades exhibit a tendency to improve over the four-year period?
4. How has the overall performance of students in INSY107 evolved from 2020 to 2023?
5. Is there any correlation between gender and academic performance in INSY107?
6. To what extent does student attendance impact their final grades in the course?
7. Can any discernible trends or patterns be identified in student attendance throughout the four-year duration?
8. Is there a noteworthy correlation between assignment scores and final exam scores?
9. Are there specific years in which students exhibited exceptional or subpar performance in INSY107?
